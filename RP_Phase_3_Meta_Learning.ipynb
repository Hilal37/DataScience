The results are similar and both of them are not good results. Also note that with and without feature selection we could not obtain better results. We will do the hypothesis testing to experiment more on the differences between these models even though all of them had bad results as in accuracy and f1-score which is mainly what we care about. NOTE that one model we tried predicted all 0's and had accuracy 99% because of its false positives and f1-score of almost 0, it is still a bad model.\n",
